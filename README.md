<h1 align="center">IBMSkillsNetwork: Python For Data Science - Brain Tumor Prediction using ML with 100% Accuracy🌈🪄</h1>
  A brain tumor is a growth of abnormal cells in the brain. The anatomy of the brain is very complex, with different parts responsible for different nervous system. Brain Tumor can develop in any part of the brain or skull, including its protective lining, the underside of the brain(skull base), the brainstem, the sinuses and the nasal cavity, and many other areas.

  Brain tumors can be cancerous(malignant) or noncancerous(benign).When benign or malignant tumors grow, they can cause the pressure inside skull to increase. This can cause brain damage, and it can be life-threating.
  
  However, Early detection and classification of brain tumors is an important research domain in the field of medical imaging and accordingly helps in selecting the most convenient treatment method to save patient life.

  But don’t worry! In the age of AI, a new ray of hope emerges. Enter artificial intelligence (AI) technology, with machine learning as one of its key techniques, which emerges as a revolutionary solution in the fight against brain tumors. This technique enables the processing of medical image data with unprecedented precision and accuracy, opening up new possibilities for more accurate and efficient brain tumor detection and classification. AI is like a superhero, ready to assist doctors in their battle against brain tumors. AI is not a replacement for doctors, but rather a powerful partner that can help them make better decisions. Doctors remain in control, combining their expertise and intuition with the power of AI.

  While achieving 100% accuracy remains a challenge, ML-based brain tumor prediction offers a more promising future💡
